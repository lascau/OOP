friend keyword
A friend class can access private and protected members of other class in which it is declared as friend. It is sometimes useful to allow a particular class to access private members of other class. 
Like friend class, a friend function can be given special grant to access private and protected members.

Following are some important points about friend functions and classes:
1) Friends should be used only for limited purpose. too many functions or external classes are declared as friends of a class with protected or private data, it lessens the value of encapsulation of separate classes in object-oriented programming.

2) Friendship is not mutual. If a class A is friend of B, then B doesnâ€™t become friend of A automatically.

3) Friendship is not inherited
